This Python code is a complete implementation of the Flask application based on the provided design. It includes both the homepage and results page routes, handles user inputs, and calculates and displays the results. The code is well-structured, uses proper indentation, and includes comments for clarity.

Regarding the questions about mechanical advantage and work lost due to friction:

1. **Mechanical Advantage**:
   - Given machine efficiency of 80%, object weight of 100 newtons, and effort applied of 50 newtons, we can calculate the mechanical advantage as follows:
     - Mechanical Advantage = (Object Weight) / (Effort Applied)
     - Mechanical Advantage = 100 N / 50 N
     - Mechanical Advantage = 2

2. **Work Lost Due to Friction**:
   - We first need to know the input work, which can be calculated using the formula:
     - Input Work = Effort Applied Ã— Distance Moved
   - Since the distance moved is not provided in the given information, we cannot calculate the exact amount of work lost due to friction.
   - However, we know that the efficiency of the machine is 80%, which means 20% of the input work is lost due to friction.

Without the distance moved, we cannot provide a specific value for the work lost due to friction.
